title: On Constraints

It's a common misconception that constraints are a bad thing.
Constraints can be a good thing.
Constraints can engender creativity.
It has for this blog.

I write this blog in Markdown.
I deploy directly from the main branch on GitHub to GitHub Pages.
I don't have a CMS.
I don't have a database.
I don't have a server.
I don't have a CDN.
I don't have a custom domain.
I use the default Jekyll theme.

These constraints have forced me to focus on the writing.
I don't have to worry about the infrastructure.
I don't have to worry about the design.
I don't have to worry about the performance.
I can just write.

Constraints help my writing too.
I keep it short.
In fact, I try to keep each sentence to a single line.
Less than 80 characters.
Markdown helps with this because paragraphs are separated by a blank line.
So one sentence per line makes each sentence have one main idea.
The first sentence therefore must be a concise topic sentence.
Hopefully, it makes for easier reading.

I used to write on WordPress.
I found all the GUI layout options distracting.
The WYSIWYG editor was too much.
I found it frustrating that I couldn't even find a theme that I liked.
All the miminalist themes didn't look right.
They would only display the first few posts.
I wanted all my posts to be displayed.

I'm happy with my current setup.
The constraints have helped freed me in an ironic way.
Embrace constraints and prosper!
