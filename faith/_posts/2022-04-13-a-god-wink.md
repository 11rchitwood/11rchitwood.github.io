Have you ever noticed a coincidence that felt like more than random chance?
It was probably a God Wink.
My mom used to call this a 24-Hour Phenomenon.
Whatever you call it, these moments are special.
They remind us that God is present in our lives.

I had a God Wink recently.
I was asked to lead [a children's Bible study lesson](2022-04-12-a-childrens-bible-study-lesson.md).
The theme was nature.
Pastor Jimmy wanted me to link the lesson to my ornithologist background.
All of this made sense to me.
Then he told me they had been going through the book of Judges.
This particular lesson was about Deborah.
To be honest, I wasn't very familiar with her story.
But as I studied, I realized that Deborah was a woman after my mom's heart.

It has been less than a year since mom died.
I miss her every day.
When this God wink came together, it felt like getting a big hug from her.
