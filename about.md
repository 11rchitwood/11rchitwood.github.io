Greetings!
My name is Ryan Chitwood, and this is ChitChat, my personal blog.
It's my internet journal where I write about whatever's on my mind.
I hope you enjoy it!

A bit more about me.
I am a Quantitative Analyst at [Synovus](https://www.synovus.com).
Before that I was the Research & Data Analyst at [PAEA](https://paeaonline.org).
I have degrees in ecology and wildlife biology from the University of Georgia.
While I was there, I studied [Black-throated Blue Warbler](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Black-throated_Blue_Warbler) population dynamics.
In my spare time, I enjoy playing basketball and hanging out with my family.

If you're in less personal, more technical stuff, check out [my portfolio](plotthedata.com).
