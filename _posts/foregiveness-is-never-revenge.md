title: Foregivness is Never Revenge
---

I just finished Serial's fourth season about Guantanamo Bay. In WHAT EPISODE, they said "Forgiveness can be an act of revenge." Why does this bother me? This isn't Gospel forgiveness. To really forgive like Jesus forgives, you lift the wrongdoer up. There is no record of wrongdoing. It's washed clean. there is no revenge in forgiveness, only empathy.
