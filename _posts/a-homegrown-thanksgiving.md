title: A Homegrown Thanksgiving
---

I love native plants, their ecology, and their history.
I love the idea of restoring the environment to "what it's supposed to be."
In practive, this is a difficult labor of love.
This November I had a new idea.
What if prepared a Thanksgiving meal using only native plants, fish, and game?
Let's try.

But first a little bit of the "why" behind the idea.
For starters, Thanksgiving is a homegrown American holiday.
I love how the holiday centers on gratitude.
It shows the good that happens when folks from different backgrounds come together.

- Smoked Turkey
- Deer backstrap
- Quail eggs
- Succotash from the three sisters: squash, maize, and beans
- Blackberries
- Cranberries
- Muscadine grapes
