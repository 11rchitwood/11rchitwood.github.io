Risen Savior,

Morning has broken like the first morning, but this one is special.

We gather here today for the biggest party of the year.

Our hearts are **full** because your tomb lay **empty**.

We can let go of **anxiety**.

We have **peace** in your sovereignty.

We can let go of **selfish anger**.

We have **joy** in your abundant love.

We can let go of **despair**.

We have **hope** in your resurrection.

Most of all, Lord, we can let go of **death**.

We have **everlasting life** in you.

Jesus, in our darkest nights and in our brightest mornings, help us to remember these truths.

We are so grateful. Amen.
