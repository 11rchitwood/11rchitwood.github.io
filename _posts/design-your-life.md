title: Design Your Life
---
Lately I've been reflecting on the "Design Your Life" idea that I think I first heard about on the ChooseFI podcast. I'm a data scientist by trade, but I have a strong interest in design in general. There are a few principles of software design that I think apply to life too.

- Separation of Concerns
- Cohesion
- Loose Coupling
- Modularity
- Encapsulation
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
