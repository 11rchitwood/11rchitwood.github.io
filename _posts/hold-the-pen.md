title: Hold the Pen
---

My mother-in-law wrote a vacation bible school curriuculum for our church.
From scratch.
Then she did it again.
It was really quite amazing.

In the meantime, she and I both wrote Advent devotionals for the church.
Then I started writing devotionals for our Ted Lasso bible study.
Then I wrote Advent devotionals again.
I haven't written this much since grade school!
But it felt easy.

I was chatting with her one day about all this writing, and here's what she said.

> It doesn't even feel like writing to me.
> God's doing the writing.
> I just hold the pen.

She nailed it.
I feel the same way.

We've just been through another presidential election cycle as a country.
It was exhausting.
Many folks, myself included, felt like both candidates were lacking.
Without going into specifics, both platforms are based on tearing folks down.

We need a leader to hold the pen.
