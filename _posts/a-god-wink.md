title: A God Wink
---

Have you ever noticed a coincidence that felt like more than random chance?
That was probably a God Wink.

Different bird, same personality, same habitat.
Sunday school and sermon address the same themes.
Why wouldn't these happen?
It's the same God moving in our lives.

My mom used to call these a 24-Hour Phenomenon.
