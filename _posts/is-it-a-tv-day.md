title: Is it a TV day?
---

It's a common refrain around our house. When Chitwood One turned two, we started letting him watch TV. At first, we only let him watch Raffi Concert, but little by little we introduced a variety of shows. That's when I foundÂ Common Sense Media. Common Sense Media is an organization that reviews and provides ratings for media and technology with the goal of providing information on their suitability for children.
