The Harry Potter books are likely the most significant novels for my generation.
Many of us waited in line outside Barnes & Noble at each release.
Many an Accelerate Reader point was earned by reading these books.

One of the most pivotal events in the series occurs in the third book.
Harry is with Sirius Black by a lake in the Forbidden Forest.
Sirius is Harry's newfound godfather, but he has been gravely wounded.
He is the first true family that the orphan Harry has ever know.
And it seems like Sirius is about to be lost to him as quickly as he was found.
As they huddle together, the lake ices over rapidly.
Down come hundreds of Dementors, ghastly wraithlike beings who devour happiness.
Harry tries to cast the Patronus spell, the only way to defeat them, but fails.
It seems that all hope is lost.

Then from cross the lake, a shimmering white stag appears made from pure light.
It drives away the Dementors and saves Harry and Sirius.
Harry is convinced that his father has returned from the grave to save them.
Only later we find out that Harry actually saved himself.
He made a small jump back in time.
Then he cast a stronger Patronus charm that appeared as his father's white stag.

What does all this have to do with Christmas?
It's simple.
Biblical hope is not wish fulfillment.
Biblical hope is based on trust in God that has developed over generations.
We read the Bible and know the stories of how God has shown up for his people.
We experience God's presence in our own lives.
We hold hope in our hearts that God will continue His good work going forward.

That's why I love this scene in Harry Potter.
To cast the Patronus spell, Harry says, "Expecto patronum."
It's the Latin for "I expect a guardian."
Back at the lake, Harry sees his past self saying, "Dad will come. I saw him."
After a while, Harry realizes he must show up for himself.
Paradoxically, he already has.

Merciful Father, we thank you for all the times you have showed up for us.
Give us the hope, the expectation, that you will show up for us going forward.
AMEN.
