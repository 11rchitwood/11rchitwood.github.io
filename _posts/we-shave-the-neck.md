title: We Shave the Neck
---

A few months after my brother moved to Bloomington, Indiana for graduate school, he had to find a barber. It seems like, even back then, a proper barbershop was hard to find. His long search ended when found a place with the slogan, “We shave the neck.” (By the way, why do these old business always but their slogans in quotes?!)

I’m a hairy guy. Sometimes it seems like the hair on the back of my neck grows more than the hair on the top of my head, so no haircut is complete without a neck shave…

So what is your “neck shave?” What’s something essential to you that others have let fall by the wayside? It’s a probably a marker of quality so make sure you “shave the neck” too.
