title: In Praise of Dial Soap
---

My dad was a wildlife biology major at Auburn. One of his degree requirements was to take a parasitology course. Now, he was not a student of great means. I think he lived in a house trailer for the majority of college. The course required students to buy expense antiseptics for class, but the professor knew that not all students could afford such expensive course materials. Instead, the professor told his students they could just buy a bar that "yellow Dial soap," and that would knock out just about anything they'd deal with in the class.

Mrs. Chitwood and I grew up in slightly different households. The idiosyncrasies that our parents bred into us don't always line up. What do you think Mrs. Chitwood said when Chitwood One got his first rash? "Ryan, wash him with some of that yellow dial soap."
