title: Your First Meal Plan
---

I'm writing this to you, my first kid to leave home for college (and anyone else who finds this interesting). You like to eat, and so do I. Cooking is a life skill, and it will serve you well.

It's a foundational recipe that can evolve into a meal plan for an entire week. Let's go.
