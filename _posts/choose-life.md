Harsh.
It's a quote from Trainspotting, Irvine Welsh's first novel.
It follows a group of heroin addicts in late 1980s Leith, Edinburgh.
It was later adapted into a movie starring a young Ewan McGregor among others.
I'm not gonna lie... it's a messed up story at parts, but it's also very honest.

Rent Boy and his cronies are life dropouts.
They are disillusioned with what life has to offer.
But rather than choosing death, they choose un-life.
They are physically living without really engaging with life.
Without spoiling much (you should read the book first), Mark has a change of heart.
At the end of the story, he chooses life.

Deuteronomy 30:19
