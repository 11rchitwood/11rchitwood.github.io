A month ago I wrote about my [dream job]({{ site.baseurl }}/2024/04/13/brookstone-ornithology-teacher).
I've been thinking about it ever since.
The main aim is to teach Ornithology.
So why not write a syllabus for the course?

## Ornithology: Exploring the Fascinating World of Birds

### Course Description

In this class, students will explore the diverse and fascinating world of birds.
From anatomy and zoology, students will learn all about birds.
The course will cover bird identification, behavior, ecology, and conservation.
They will engage in hands-on activities, field trips, and research projects.
By the end of the course, students will be able to call themselves birders.

### Learning Objectives

1. Identify many bird species based on their physical characteristics.
1. Understand avian anatomy, physiology, and adaptations for flight.
1. Explore bird behavior including birdsong, mating systems, and migration.
1. Investigate the ecological roles of birds in various ecosystems.
1. Analyze the impact of humans on bird populations and their habitats.
1. Develop skills in bird observation, identification, and data collection.
1. Understand conservation methods for protecting bird species and habitats.
1. Cultivate a sense of wonder, curiosity, and respect for birds.
