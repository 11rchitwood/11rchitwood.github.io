title: Shalom

Shalom means wholeness. God created wholeness. Satan (literally translated "The Opposer") created division. God's creation is holistic, that is, greater than the sum of its parts. John 1 says it all. "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." How can this be?
