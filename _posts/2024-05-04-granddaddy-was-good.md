The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, **goodness**, gentleness, and self-control.

Goodness. When I think about my Granddaddy, I think about his goodness. When I was younger, I often thought about the old question, “Am I going to be a good man or a great man?” Then I would think about Granddaddy and know that being a good man can lead to a great life.

You see, great men are concerned with their accomplishments, asking “What have a I done to make an impact?” Good men are concerned with how they treat others. To paraphrase, “Love God. Love people.” I think granddaddy lived this out, God's greatest commandment. He wasn't perfect, but he knew that all people are created in the image of God, so he treated them that way.

Granddaddy also kept things simple. He enjoyed morning walks, cutting up with friends, and a good meal with family. He came from humble beginnings, and while he did accomplish much in life, he never lost that humility. He was just a pleasure to be around.

My favorite thing with him growing up was coming down to Seale on the weekends and finding some project to work on together. It would be Granddaddy, Dad, and me. Three generations piddling in the yard, maintaining the little road on his property, or fishing at Uncle Jimmy's pond. Those were great days.

As I got older, I learned that I could always confide in Granddaddy. He was one of the first people I told when we were expecting our first child. I knew he wouldn't care (or maybe even remember) to tell anyone, but it meant a lot to the two of us in the moment. You should have seen the look on his face when I told him we were having a boy. Reid Worley Chitwood. The fourth Worley in a row.

Hard times came, and my wife ended up in the hospital during that pregnancy. We weren't sure if we were going to get to keep the baby. It was the middle of COVID, I was home alone, and I was totally out of my depth as a husband. Granddaddy never seemed to worry much. He'd whistle through just about anything, so I came to him and said, “Granddaddy, what should I do?” He said, “Don't worry. It'll all work out.” I didn't really believe him, but I could tell that he believed. That helped me believe, and he was right: it did work out. We got to keep Reid, and now we have two boys. I will always treasure getting to share those moments with him, both the good and the bad.

So when you think of my Granddaddy, think of how you might do good by someone else, think of how you might enjoy the simple things in life, and finally try to whistle your way through whatever worries you have. Thank you.
