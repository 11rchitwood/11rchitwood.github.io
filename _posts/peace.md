# Day 1: In the Garden

> I come to the garden alone,
>
> Where the dew is still on the roses;
>
> And the voice I hear, falling on my ear,
>
> The Son of God discloses
>
> "In the Garden" -- C. Austin Miles

Have you ever noticed all the gardens in the Bible? There are several
that come to mind. First, God makes our first home in a garden. He
plants the entire expanse and gives it to us to tend. God is present
with Adam and Eve, and they fully experience His love. This is a garden
of safety and togetherness.

Much later, moments before he is betrayed, Jesus goes to the Garden of
Gethsemane to commune with the Father. He prays, *Father, if you are
willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done.*
(Luke 22:42). This is our Lord and Savior at his most raw. Jesus is
showing us how to be vulnerable to the Lord and to each other. This is a
garden of authenticity and faithfulness.

After the crucifixion, Jesus is buried in a tomb at a garden. At the
resurrection, just before he ascends into heaven, he appears to Mary
Magdalene as a gardener. She is so upset that she doesn't recognize him,
but when she does, Jesus turn her mourning into tears of joy. This is a
garden of justice and holiness.

Why all these gardens? These gardens represent the tension between life
and death, holiness and sin. A garden displays the wonders of God's
creation but in a controlled environment. Wilderness can show this same
glory but not without danger. The built environment can mimic nature's
beauty but never recreate it. Thus, God gives us gardens where we can
feel His presence, talk to Him, and know that He is in control.

**Prayer:** God, give me the peace of a garden. One where all the noise
of life falls away and only You and Your majesty remain. AMEN.

# Day 2: Children of God

> Who am I that the highest King would welcome me?
>
> I was lost, but He brought me in
>
> Oh His love for me
>
> Oh His love for me
>
> Who the Son sets free
>
> Oh, is free indeed
>
> I\'m a child of God, yes, I am
>
> "Who You Say I Am" -- Hillsong

Since before I can remember, my mom always quoted Matthew 5:9 to me,
*Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.*
If my friends were fighting at school, I would come home distraught. I
would only relax when I knew the conflict was resolved.

But God's peace is not defined by a lack of conflict. Our Lord's peace
doesn't just take conflict away. It cuts through the conflict to reveal
the sin at its core. Only once that has been addressed does God's peace
settle in.

This makes me think of Jesus' encounter with the woman at the well in
John 4. I don't think the woman's trip to the well was a particularly
peaceful part of her day. With her checkered past, she probably dreaded
coming to the local watering hole for fear of gossipers and the like.
When she found Jesus there that day, I imagine her anxiety intensified.

Further, there are cultural dynamics at play. The woman is a Samaritan,
and we are told, *The Samaritan woman said to him, "You are a Jew, and I
am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?" (For Jews do not
associate with Samaritans.)* So, the woman faces conflict for choices
she made (her marital history) and those she didn't (the culture she was
born into).

Jesus could do any number of things here. He could tell her to fix her
messed-up. He could tell her to adopt Jewish customs instead. He could
stop associating with her altogether. He could even reverse course and
tell her that she had done nothing wrong. He does none of these.
Instead, we read: *Jesus answered her, "If you knew the gift of God and
who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked* *him and he
would have given you living water."* He goes on to say, *Everyone who
drinks this water will be thirsty again, but whoever drinks the water I
give them will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give them will become
in them a spring of water welling up to eternal life.*

Our Savior doesn't simply remove conflict. He points us to what we need,
living water that moves us to share His story and become a part of it.
We become a Child of God not by being born in His family or earning our
place, but by committing our lives to His purpose.

**Prayer:** Lord, give me your living water so that I may drink of it
and not thirst again. Make me a wellspring that waters all around me.
Call me one of your children. AMEN. ï¿¼

# Day 3: Waging Heavy Peace

> Don\'t forget love, don\'t forget love, don\'t forget love
>
> When you got no one you can confide in, don\'t forget love
>
> In every story there\'s a secret hiding, don\'t forget love
>
> When you\'re taking when you could be giving
>
> When you\'re dying and you could be living, don\'t forget love
>
> > "Don't Forget Love" -- Neil Young

When the Jewish people imagined their coming Messiah, many probably
didn't imagine a baby in a manger born to a carpenter and his wife.
Maybe they imagined a great warrior, someone to conquer their enemies.
Or maybe they thought of a king seated on an earthly throne that would
rule with an iron will. God's story always seems to take us unexpected.

Praise God for the Prince of Peace that we did receive, one who embodies
the lion and the lamb. *The lion and the lamb.* Do you know where this
phrase comes from? One possible origin is from a Saint Augustine sermon,
*He \[Christ\] endured death as a lamb; he devoured it as a lion."* Only
in Jesus can these opposing symbols exist.

Some years ago, I was browsing my dad's bookshelf, and one title jumped
out at me: *Waging Heavy Peace*. It was Neil Young's autobiography. I
think the phrase applies even more to Christ. After Jesus has won the
victory over death, he lays out his grand battle plan, the Great
Commission*,* *Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing
them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And* *surely
I am with you always, to the very end of the age."* (Matthew 28:19-20).

**Prayer:** Jesus, make me a soldier for Peace in Your grand campaign of
Love. Thank You for showing up in my life in ways that I cannot imagine.
Wherever I go, I pray that Your love goes with me also. AMEN.

# Day 4: Rest in Peace; Rest in Power

> > Mother, mother
>
> > There\'s too many of you crying
>
> > Brother, brother, brother
>
> > There\'s far too many of you dying
>
> > You know we\'ve got to find a way
>
> > To bring some loving here today
>
> > "What's Going On" -- Marvin Gaye

RIP, *requiescat in pace*, rest in peace. It's a common thing to say
when someone we love has died. Really, the phrase is a small but
powerful prayer asking God to give someone His peace after they've left
this world. But sometimes we're not feeling so peaceful at the end of a
loved one's life.

When Jesus' friend Lazarus had died, you can feel Mary and Martha's
pain. *"Lord," Martha said to Jesus, "if you had been here, my brother
would not have died. But I know that even now God will give you whatever
you ask."* (John 11:21-22). And later, *When Mary reached the place
where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said, "Lord, if
you had been here, my brother would not have died."* (John 11: 32).
Today, they might instead have said, "Jesus, it's just not fair!" But
Jesus knows that death is not fair. That's why he came to overcome it.
In this story, Jesus even shows us that it's okay to not be okay with
death in shortest verse of all, *Jesus wept.* (John 11:35).

I hear the words of Martha and Mary in every protest and social justice
movement today. No matter how controversial, no Christian wants to see
their brother or sister killed. It's no wonder that *rest in peace* has
a new variation, *rest in power*. It's a prayer of its own asking God to
give the deceased rest in His power. It's an admission that we as
Christians know that only true justice can be served by our Lord.

But it doesn't end there. God completes his justice story, not just in
the resurrection of Lazarus, but the resurrection of Jesus. Jesus pays
the ultimate price for our sin (that is, our separation from God's way)
on the cross. Then, he overcomes that price in His resurrection.

**Prayer:** Father, the world needs Your resurrection power. Wield it
today so that we may come alive in faith. AMEN.

# Day 5: Peace Like a River

> > When peace like a river, attendeth my way,
>
> > When sorrows like sea billows roll;
>
> > Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say
>
> > It is well, it is well, with my soul.
>
> > "It Is Well with My Soul" -- Horatio Spafford

Tragedy led to Horatio Spafford writing these lyrics. First, he lost his
business and livelihood in the Great Chicago Fire. Then, all four of his
daughters die in a shipwreck. Finally, he lost his son to scarlet fever.
After losing almost everything, how could Spafford even think "it is
well," much less write what has become an iconic hymn?

Spafford's story reminds me of Jesus calming the storm. The story is
told in three of the four gospels. In all three, the main points are the
same. Jesus and the disciples are crossing the Sea of Galilee when a
great storm comes up. Jesus is sleeping, seemingly unfazed. Next comes a
key difference. In Matthew and Luke, the disciples exclaim to Jesus that
they are going to drown, but in Mark, they instead say, "Teacher, don't
you care if we drown?" Then, Jesus calms the storm and questions the
disciples' faith. The story ends with the disciples in awe of what has
transpired.

"Don't you *care* if we drown?" Even with Jesus right there with them,
albeit sleeping, the disciples felt like he wasn't there for them. This
story shows us that in times of great stress or loss, it's normal to
doubt God or not feel his presence. But it also shows how our Lord is
always in control and always delivers.

So how can Spafford proclaim "it is well" after such tragedies? Faith
alone. He clearly knew that our God cares. He may not have known what an
impact his story and words would make on the world, but he did know how
God can use a tragedy to write a triumph.

**Prayer:** God, give us peace like a river. And when storms arise in
our lives, let us have the faith so that no matter what happens we can
proclaim, "It is well." AMEN.

# Day 6: Just a Closer Walk with Thee

> I am weak but Thou art strong
>
> Jesus keep me from all wrong
>
> I\'ll be satisfied as long
>
> As I walk, let me walk close to Thee

Whenever conflict arises in my family, we take a walk. It's amazing how
much tension can be resolved by putting one foot in front of another,
together. I think God made us this way. When out on a walk, you are
forced to be mindful of your body rather than being stuck in your head.
You might notice God's creation around you, talk with a neighbor, or
just enjoy getting a little bit of exercise. Sometimes it helps to just
feel as though you're making physical progress, even if you solve
nothing with the real issue at hand.

There are many important walks in the Bible that come to mind. After
eating of the forbidden fruit, Adam and Eve hear God walking in the
garden and hide. After leaving Egypt, the Israelites are led by a pillar
of cloud then fire in the desert. Eventually, they walk into the
Promised Land. In the nativity story, Joseph and Mary make the
pilgrimage to Bethlehem. At the end of his life, Jesus carries his own
cross to Golgotha. On the road to Damascus, Saul encountered Jesus, was
blinded, and endured one his most difficult walks ever. Then he was
healed, baptized, and filled with the Holy Spirit. We now know of his
great deeds in the name of the Lord.

On each of these walks, God works change into the lives of his people.
God discovering Adam and Eve is the inciting event for the rest of his
redemption story. The Promised Land shows us how God is faithful to his
people. The pilgrimage to Bethlehem shows us how God uses humble
beginning to change the world. Jesus carrying his own cross shows us how
God bears the weight of our sin. And Paul's conversion shows us how God
can change the unlikeliest of hearts.

**Prayer:** Lord, thank you for walking faithfully with us. Through the
good and the bad, help us to always proclaim "it is well." AMEN. ï¿¼

# Day 7: Shalom, Salaam, Aloha

> > The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
>
> > Are also on the faces of people passing by
>
> > I see friends shaking hands saying \"How do you do?\"
>
> > They\'re really saying \"I, I love you\"
>
> > "What a Wonderful World" -- Israel KamakawiwoÊ»ole

*Shalom, Salaam, Aloha.* These are the words for peace in Hebrew,
Arabic, and Hawaiian respectively. Each version of the word has multiple
meanings, but they all have one common use: a hello or goodbye between
loved ones. In fact, Jesus uses the word *peace* in the very same way
when he foretells his departure from this world. *Peace I leave with
you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do
not let your* *hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.* (John 14:27).

The Hebrew word, *shalom*, is perhaps the closest of these to our
Christian lineage. The peace of shalom means wholeness. If you are a
parent, it's the feeling when all your children are safe under your
roof. It also means well-being. Maybe you've felt shalom after
recovering from illness when you finally felt your body was back in
complete working order. In the Jewish tradition, Shalom can be
considered one of the names of God, not unlike how we call Jesus "the
Prince of Peace" or say, "God is love."

The Arabic word, *salaam*, is closely related. You may have heard the
greeting, "As-salamu alaykum," and its response, "Wa alaykumu s-salam,"
in Muslim culture. We say it in English too, "Peace be with you," and
the response, "And also with you." Both are often shortened to "Salaam"
and "Peace" respectively. Salaam has the same root as Islam, which
literally means "submission," so to receive God's peace is to submit to
Him fully.

Finally, from a far different culture, comes the Hawaiian word, *aloha*.
It means many things: hello, goodbye, love, affection, peace,
compassion, and mercy. But its meaning runs far deeper than literal
translation. To native Hawaiians, aloha is the stuff that holds the
world together. I think we Christians would simply call that God.

God gave us the gift of language. No other animal on Earth has the same
ability. It's no coincidence that the word for peace in all these
languages points to what God is like.

**Prayer:** God, thank you for loving us so that we may name you Peace.
May we submit to your will and your will alone so that we may know your
peace. Hold us together as you do all creation. AMEN.
