## Hope for the Flowers

One of the best gifts I ever received was from my Sunday school teachers in 12th grade. It was a yellow book with a butterfly on it called *Hope for the Flowers* by Trina Paulus. The cover explained that it was a "a tale - partly about life, partly about revolution, and lots about hope - for adults and other including caterpillars who can read". If you can, read it yourself, but I'll try to summarize here.

The story follows a caterpillar named Stripe. He hatches from an egg, eats, and grows, but he has a feeling there must be more to life. One day he discovers a pillar of caterpillars, all climbing over one another, that stretches up to the clouds. They are seeking soem unknown goal. He joins in and along the way meets a friend, Yellow. They fall in love and eventually give up the climb to live together, but the feeling that there is more to life never leaves Stripe. Eventually, he sets back off to the climb, abandoning Yellow. Sad and alone, Yellow discovers another caterpillar forming a cocoon and, though doubtful, decides to do the same. Meanwhile, Stripe is bigger and stronger and makes it to the top of the climb to discover nothing but a clear vantage point with thousands of other caterpillar pillars around. Then, buttefly Yellow visits him. He doesn't understand at first but ultimately she convinces him to become a butterfly too, and they live happily ever after.

There's more depth to the parable than I can convey here, but there's a pivotal moment I want to zoom in on. The first cocoon-building caterpillar tells Yellow that to become a butterfly, "You must want to fly so much that you are willing to give up being a caterpiller." Yellow asks them if this means she has to die. "Yes and No," he says. "Life is changed, not taken away." This is the ultimate hope-building move. Paul says it this way in Galatians 2:20, "I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me."

*Author of Hope, give us the courage to die to ourselves and take up our cross daily and follow you. AMEN.*
