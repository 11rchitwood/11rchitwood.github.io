title: Child Honoring

We're big Raffi fans at the Chitwood House. We're such big fans that Chitwood One thought our TV only played "Raffi Concert" for the for the first few months we let him watch.

Child HonouringÂ is holistic philosophy that prioritizes the needs of children in order to build a humane and sustainable world. It was developed my Raffi, and we think it's pretty great.
