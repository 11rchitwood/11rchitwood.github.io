Greetings! My name is Ryan Chitwood. I am a Quantitative Analyst at [Synovus](https://www.synovus.com). Before that I was the Research & Data Analyst at [PAEA](https://paeaonline.org). I have degrees in ecology and wildlife biology from the [University of Georgia](https://www.uga.edu/). While I was there, I studied [Black-throated Blue Warbler](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Black-throated_Blue_Warbler) population dynamics. In my spare time, I enjoy playing basketball and hanging out with my family.
